### About Me

Since I wrote my first line of JavaScript, I’ve been hooked on turning ideas into real, usable web solutions. Over the past three years, I’ve grown from experimenting with small side projects to building production-ready applications — including a published Chrome Extension that’s actively used by a growing number of people. Each project taught me more about crafting performant, privacy-minded, and user-focused web experiences.

Along the way, I’ve also helped organize nationwide tech events in Nepal, from hackathons to learning challenges, which showed me the power of teamwork, community, and solving real problems at scale. I’m now a Full Stack Developer with skills beyond the MERN Stack, always aiming to create solutions that genuinely matter.
