### I'm Tilak Thapa, a web/app developer.

I'm a curiosity-driven developer with over 2 years of expertise in building robust web applications using the MERN stack and Next.js. 💻 My hands-on experience extends to Docker and cloud deployment on AWS, allowing me to deliver high-quality solutions that meet diverse needs.

As a firm believer in the power of continuous improvement, I resonate with the quote: "The only way to do great work is to love what you do." — Steve Jobs. This passion drives me to participate in hackathons, share insights through blogging, and create meaningful user experiences that extend beyond just writing code. 📚

_"Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it's bad." — Cory House._
